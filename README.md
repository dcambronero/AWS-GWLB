# CloudGuard GWLB Deployment on AWS
This Terraform project is intended to be used as a template in a demonstration or to build a test environment.  
What it does is creates an infrastructure composed of application VPCs, Shared Services VPC, Transit Gateway, and protect them with an auto-scaling group of CloudGuard gateways by using the newly AWS GWLB service.    These applications will have then the East-West and Outgoing traffic protected by CloudGuard Instances.    

## Do you want to see more?    
The following diagram is based on the Architecture NÂ°2 design of Check Point GWLB in AWS.

## Which are the components created?
The project creates the following resources and combines them:
1. **Spokes VPCs**: Application VPCs with testing EC2s 
2. **Service VPC**: Single VPC dedicated to host VPC Endpoints
3. **Security VPC**: Single VPC dedicated to host the CloudGuard gateways ASG
4. **Transit Gateway**: Transit Gateway to connect the different VPCs
5. **Transit Gateway Config**: Transit gateway attachments, and routing configuration
6. **GWLB Service**: In the security VPC with its endpoint
7. **GWLB Auto-Scaling Group**: Attached to the GWLB service to provide security enforcement
8. **Private Route53 Zone**: Used to share VPC Endpoints hosted in the Service VPC
9. **VPC Endpoints and host registration**: Used to access EC2 / ECR / RDS / CloudFormation services privately

## How to use it
The only thing that you need to do is change the __*terraform.tfvars*__ file located in this directory.

If you want (or need) to further customize other project details, you can change defaults in the different __*name-variables.tf*__ files.   
Here you will also be able to find the descriptions that explain what each variable is used for.
